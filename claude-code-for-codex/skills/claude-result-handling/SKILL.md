  Internal guidance for presenting claude-companion helper output back to the user. Not a
  user-invocable command — applies whenever any claude-* command-skill or the `claude-rescue`
  agent has helper output to hand back, defining what to preserve, what never to auto-apply, and
  how to report a failed or unauthenticated run.

# Claude Result Handling

When the helper returns Claude Code output:

- Preserve the helper's verdict, summary, findings, and next-steps structure.
- For review output, present findings first and keep them ordered by severity.
- Use the file paths and line numbers exactly as the helper reports them.
- Preserve evidence boundaries. If Claude Code marked something as an inference, uncertainty, or
  follow-up question, keep that distinction.
- Preserve output sections when the prompt asked for them, such as observed facts, inferences,
  open questions, touched files, or next steps.
- If there are no findings, say that explicitly and keep the residual-risk note brief.
- If Claude Code made edits, say so explicitly and list the touched files when the helper provides
  them.
- For `claude-rescue`, do not turn a failed or incomplete Claude Code run into a Codex-side
  implementation attempt. Report the failure and stop.
- For `claude-rescue`, if Claude Code was never successfully invoked, do not generate a substitute
  answer at all.
- CRITICAL: after presenting review findings, STOP. Do not make any code changes. Do not fix any
  issues. Explicitly ask which issues, if any, should be fixed before touching a single file.
  Auto-applying fixes from a review is strictly forbidden, even if the fix is obvious.
- If the helper reports malformed output or a failed Claude Code run, include the most actionable
  stderr lines and stop there instead of guessing.
- If the helper reports that setup or authentication is required, direct the user to `claude-setup`
  and do not improvise alternate auth flows.
